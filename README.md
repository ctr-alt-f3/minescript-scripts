My minescript scripts. Most of them are self-explanatory. Some of them require minescript+ to run


"zbigniew.py" and "zbigniew2.py" are inside jokes, you won't know why it is funny

"chatbot.py" is not mine - here is link for [this script](https://minescript.net/sdm_downloads/chatbot-v1/)

lib_java and lib_nbt are not mine too - they are a dependency of minescript+
